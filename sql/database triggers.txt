database triggers
	triggers
		Named PL/SQL blocks which are store in the database
		specialized stored programs which execute implicitly 
			when a triggering event occurs
		**cannot run and execute them directly
			they only get triggered by events in the database
			
	events that trigger execution
		DML statement
			any update, insert, delete executing on any table in database
		
		DDL statement
			any create or alter, 
				these triggers are generally used by DBAs for auditing purposes
				
		system event
			shutdown or startup of database

		User event
			logoff or logon
	
	
	types of triggers
		DML triggers
			triggers depend on DML statement
			
		DDL statement
			triggers created over DDL statement
			
		System/database event triggers
			triggers depend on system events
			
		instead-of triggers
			enables you to stop and redirect the performance of a DML statement
			helps you in managing the way you write non-updatable views
			
		compound triggers
			multi-tasking triggers that act as both statement as well as Row-level triggers
				when the data is inserted, updated, or deleted from a table
			can be used to audit, check, save and replace the values before they are changed
