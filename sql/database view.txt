database views
	views are like temporary tables
		shortcut for not re-typing a query each time it is used
	
	**views do NOT contain any real data
		they are holding data from *other tables
		
	view is a view into another table
		
when to use a view
	return the top 10 most bided items
		SELECT id, name, bids, FROM items ORDER BY bids DESC LIMIT 10
	
	if we want to diplay this info in different places in our app
		we can run this query every time we want to display this info
		
	**better solution is to use a view
		make a view out of this query
	
			CREATE VIEW mostbids AS
				SELECT id, name, bids FROM items ORDER BY bids DESC LIMIT 10
	
		**view do not hold any data
			its data comes from the table 
			
		**data on the view is dynamic
			view data changes if table data is updated
			**better than creating a new table 
				which will need to be updated whenever parent table is updated
	
	**we can treat view as a table
		run select statements on a view
			select name, bids from mostbids
	
	
to find out all the views created in a database	
	
	select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS;
