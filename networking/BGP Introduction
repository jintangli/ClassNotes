Introduction to BGP
    design as an Exterior Gateway Protocol
        The only Exterior Gateway Protocol currently available
    advertises, learns, and chooses the best path inside the global internet
        learning massive quantity of internet routs that are unable to handle by interior routing protocols
            EIGRP and OSPF cannot handle more than 4,000 routes
    ISPs typically use BGP to exchange routing information between themselves
    can also be used for very large enterprise networks
        enterprise network can have large numbers of subnets that EIGRP or OSPF cannot handle
        run BGP in the core routers of enterprise networks
    Enterprises sometimes use BGP to exchange routing info with one or more ISPs
        when enterprise have offices scatter around the globe using different ISPs
    BGP has robust best-path algorithm
        BGP check more to decide the best path
            the best path is selected based on multiple criteria
        **because of this complex and robust best-path algorithm,
            different attributes of BGP can be changed,
            according to design needs,
            to influence the selection of the best path.
            JTL: BGP gives user more control in setting which route will be the best path, ASW direct connect uses this feature of BGP
            JTL: This feature makes BGP keep only one best route for each prefix (not impossible but hard to have more then one)
