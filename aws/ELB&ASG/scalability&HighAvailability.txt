scalability 
	application/system can handle greater loads by adapting
		vertical scalability
			common for non-distributed systems
				RDS, ElastiCache
		horizontal scalability
			implies distributed systems with auto scaling group and load balancer
				web applications, modern applications
	

High Availability
	running application/system in at least 2 data centers / availability zones
		can survive data center loss
		
		
Elastic Load Balancer
	forward internet traffic to multiple servers/ec2 instance
		load balancer is the *single point of entry (DNS) for user
			requests go through load balancer to ec2 instance
			response go through load balancer to user
			
		ec2 instances can scale in/out in the back end
			spread load across multiple downstream instances
			seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
