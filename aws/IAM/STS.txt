security token service (STS)
----------------------------
	
STS 
	**provides temporary security credentials for accessing *aws resources 
	is a global service
	

temporary credentials	
	**basis for role and identity federation
	configurable and limited lifetime
		generated dynamically when requested
		no need to distribute or embed long-term security credentials
		no need to rotate or explicitly revoke them when no longer needed

temporary credentials scenarios
	identity federation
		manage users in an *external system outside of aws
		grant them access to your *aws resources
	role assumption
		manage access requests from within aws 
		
		
identity Federation		
	two types of id federation based on where the *external system resides	
	
	**Enterprise identity federation: single sign-on (SSO)
		authenticate users in your organization's network without creating new aws identities for them
			support Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
			
	**Web identity federation	
		sign in using well-known **third party identity providers
			Google, Facebook, Amazon or any OpenID Connect(OIDC)2.0 compatible providers
			
			
role assumption
	*role for cross-account access	
		allow user from one account to access another account
		**both accounts need to be in same organization
		
	*roles for amazon EC2
		allow application running on EC2 to access aws resources
		
	other aws services
		allow aws services to access aws resources
