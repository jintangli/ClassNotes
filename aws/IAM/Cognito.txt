cognito
-------

cognito
	provides authentication, authorization, and user management for *your web and mobile apps
	users can sign in 
		directly with a user name and password
		through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple

		
		
two main components
	user pools
		provide authentication
		user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for app users
		
	identity pools
		provide authorization
		grant users access to other *aws services
			**federated authentication using STS in background
				**cognito handles the aws STS calls for us







underlying protocols and standards
	OAuth2 
		an open standard for authorization between various parties
		for internet users to authorize websites to access their information on other websites
		authorize with access token rather than credentials
	
	OpenID Connect (OIDC)
		built on top of OAuth2
		detail specification for identity
			JWT, ID, Access Token, Refresh Token
	 
in summary, Cognito User Pools and Cognito Identity Pools encapsulate the functionality 
which you would normally need to write yourself to go from a SAML provider to a user 
database to a mapping of users to permissions to being able to retrieve AWS credentials 
for those permissions. Instead of making auth calls to a SAML provider (or implementing your own auth), 
implementing a user database, and then making AWS credentials for a user's privileges, 
they allow you to configure a user pool to use a given provider (or Cognito's own auth), 
point an identity pool at the user pool, and tell the identity pool what permissions members 
of the user pool should have. All the rest is done in the background, for you.
