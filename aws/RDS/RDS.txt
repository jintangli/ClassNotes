RDS overview
	multi-AZ
		standby instance in another availability zone
	read replica
		scalable reads and can be used as disaster recovery plan
	auto backup
		configurable schedule and configurable retention period
	configurable storage
		general purpose, provisioned IOPS, magnetic
	IAM Authentication
		useful for temporary access
	cloudwatch logs
		enhanced monitoring metrics

read replicas
	read only copy
	can cross region
	asynchronous update
	can be manually promoted to s standalone database
	
	
multi-AZ
	single region, cross AZ
	synchronous update
	automatic failover
	back up snapshot can be done from standby instance
	Double the cost because standby instance cost the same as the primary
	
backup and restore
	automatic backups 
		take a storage volume snapshot and store in S3 for duration of the retention period
		enable by default, happen every 30 mins, retention period upto 35 days
	manual snapshot
		store in s3 until they are deleted
		
Monitoring in RDS
	event and event notification
		provide visibility into RDS activity, such as failover, configuration changes, or maintenance
		integrates with SNS to provide event notification
	
	enhanced monitoring
		access to real-time metrics from the **underlying OS using an agent
			cloudwatch retrieve metrics from hypervisor not from OS
			enhance monitoring can view *Free Memory, cloudwatch CANNOT
		adjustable granularity down to one-second interval
		
	performance insights
		provides insight into database load, wait events, top SQL, top hosts, top users

RTO and RPO
	recovery point --------------------- disaster event -------------------- resume operations
		data loss: the amount of time between last back up and the disaster event
		down time: the amount of time between disaster and becoming fully operational 
	
	RTO	: recovery time objective
		max amount of time the recovery process can take
		
	RPO : recovery point objective
		max amount of data we afford to loss
