AWS Regions
  AWS has regions all around the world
    example: us-east-1

  each region has minimum of 3 availability zones (AZ)
    AZ name adds letter after region name, letter a - f
        example: us-east-1a, us-east-1b
    global-infrastructure page shows the different regions
      and number of AZ inside each region

  each AZ is a physical data center in the region
    but separate from each other so that they are isolated from disasters

  ** AWS console are region scoped
    * except IAM and S3, they are global services
    * console actions are performed to the selected region

IAM
  Identity Access Management
    ** root account should never be used and shared
      use MultiFactorAuthentication(MFA) to protect root account

    create IAM users
      log in as IAM users

    create groups with attached policies
      assign users to groups and users will inherit group policies

    users must be created with proper permissions
      give users the minimum permissions for doing their job

  IAM manages AWS security
      users
        physical person
      groups
        group contains users
          by function: admins, devops
          by teams: engineering, design
        users will inherit permissions applied to groups
      roles
        internal usage within AWS resources
          roles are for machines and applications, NOT for physical person

  policies defines what users, groups, roles can and cannot do
    policies are written in JSON
    IAM has predefined policies

  ** IAM has global view
    users, groups and roles created will be across all regions

  IAM federation
    big enterprises usually integrate their own repository of users with IAM
      one can login to AWS using their company credentials
      identity federation use SAML standard
        example: MicroSoft Active directory
