Routet53 is a *Global service

Routet53 is a Managed DNS service
	A     : host name to IPv4
	AAAA  : host name to IPv6
	CNAME : host name to host name
	Alias : host name to AWS resource
	
Routet53 can use
	public domain names you own/buy
	private domain names that can be resolved by your instances in your VPCs
	
Routet53 has advanced features:
	load balancing (aka: client load balancing)
	health checks
	routing policy: simple, failOver, geoLocation, latency, weighted, multiValue
	
 
DNS records TTL
	web browser will cache DNS record for TTL duration

CNAME vs Alias
	*AWS resources (loadBalancer, CloudFront...) expose AWS hostname
		ex: lbl-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
	
	CNAME points a hostname to any other hostname
		Only works for *NON-Root Domain
			ex: app.mydomain.com => xxx.yyy.com
		
	Alias points hostname to an *AWS resource
		works for *Root domain and NON-Root domain
			ex: mydomain.com => xxx.amazonaws.com
		
Routing policy
	simple
		use when need to redirect to a resource
		*cannot attach health checks to simple routing policy
		if *multiple values are returned, client choose a random one
		
	weighted
		control the percentage of the requests that go to specific endpoint
			create *multiple weighted record sets, specify weighted percentage in each of them
		can attach health checks
		*helpful to split small traffic to test new app version
		*helpful to split traffic between two regions
		
	latency
		redirect to the server that has the least latency
			create *multiple latency record sets, each of them need to be in *different region
		latency is evaluated in terms of user to designated AWS *region
