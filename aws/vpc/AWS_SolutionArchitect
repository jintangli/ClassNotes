VPC
  VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud
    you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define
      ec2 instances
      routers
      route tables
      internet gateways
    you have complete control over your virtual networking environment
      selection of your own ip address range
      creation of subnet
      configuration of route tables and network gateways
    you can customize the network configuration for your VPC
      public-facing subnet for your web server
      private-facing subnet for your databases
    you can leverage multiple layers of security
      security groups
      network ACL

VPC with public & private subnets
  EC2 instance is inside Subnet; Subnet is inside VPC; VPC is inside a region
  Internet gateway -> router -> router table -> network ACL -> subnet -> security group -> EC2 instances
    network ACL are stateless
    defines allow rule and deny rule

range of private subnet address
  10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
  172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
  192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
  * The largest subnet in Amazon is  /16
  * The smallest subnet in Amazon is /28

what can we do with a VPC
  launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
  assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
  configure route tables between subnets
  create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
  much better security control over your AWS resources
  instance security groups
  subnet network access control lists (ACLS)

default VPC vs Custom VPC
  default VPC is user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances
  all subnets in default VPC have a route out to the Internet
  each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address

VPC Peering
  allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private ip addresses
  instances behave as if they were on the same private network
  you can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same accounts
  peering is in a star configuration: i.e. 1 central VPC peers with 4 others
    *NO TRANSITIVE PEERING!
  you can peer between regions

Exam Tips
  think of VPC as a logical data center in AWS
  consists of IGWs (or virtual private gateways), route tables, network ACLs, subnets, and security groups
  * 1 subnet = 1 availability zone
    1 subnet CANNOT across multiple availability zones
    multiple subnets can be inside the same availability zone
  security Groups are stateful; network Access Control Lists are stateless
  NO TRANSITIVE PEERING
