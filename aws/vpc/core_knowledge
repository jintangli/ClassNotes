vpc Introduction

    what vpc
        an isolated environment in AWS that is dedicated to an user
            each vpc is logically isolated from other vpc
        user has full control over resources hosted inside vpc
    vpc is region specific
        vpc cannot span more than one regions
        vpc can span more than one availability zones in the same region
    vpc contains subnets
        one subnet cannot span more than one availability zones
        one availability zone can have more than one subnets

    vpc components
        CIDR and ip addresses for subnets
            10.0.0.0/8
            172.16.0.0/12
            192.168.0.0/16
            *AWS supports minimum /28 and maximum /16
        implied router
            created by AWS by default
            allow subnets communicate with each other and go out to internet
        route tables
            used by implied router to route packets
            evaluated from top to bottom
        internet gateway (IGW)
            allow vpc communicate with internet
        security groups
            function in the virtual nic level
            virtual firewall protecting EC2 instances
            *security groups are stateful
        network access control list (NACL)
            function in the subnet level
            first line of defense in vpc, protecting subnets
            *NACL are NOT stateful
        virtual private gateway (VGW)
            for communication between AWS and on premise datacenter

##
implied routers and route tables

    implied router
        central routing function within vpc
            connects different subnets
                communication within vpc
            connects vpc with IGW
                communication with internet
            connects vpc with VGW
                communication with on premise datacenter

    route tables
        define rules forwarding traffics within vpc
            AWS create main route table by Default
            user create custom route tables
            up to 200 tables per vpc

        each subnet MUST be associated with only one route table
            route table has entries define forwarding rules
            up to 50 entries per route table

        subnet will associate with main route table if not specify
            can change subnet to associate with another route table

        main route table can be edited but NOT deleted
            can add or remove entries in main route table
            can set custom route table become main route table

        every route table comes with default route
            default route allows vpc subnets to communicate with each other
            can NOT edit or delete this default route


##
ip addressing

    cannot change CIDR block range after vpc is created
        can expand existing vpc by adding secondary CIDR block
            new entry will add to each routable for this new CIDR block
            new CIDR block cannot overlap with existing CIDR block

    *different subnets within a vpc cannot overlap
