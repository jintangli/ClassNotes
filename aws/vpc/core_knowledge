vpc Introduction

    what vpc
        an isolated environment in AWS that is dedicated to an user
            each vpc is logically isolated from other vpc
        user has full control over resources hosted inside vpc
    vpc is region specific
        vpc cannot span more than one regions
        vpc can span more than one availability zones in the same region
    vpc contains subnets
        one subnet cannot span more than one availability zones
        one availability zone can have more than one subnets

    vpc components
        CIDR and ip addresses for subnets
            *AWS supports minimum /28 and maximum /16
            10.0.0.0/8
            172.16.0.0/12
            192.168.0.0/16
        implied router
            created by AWS by default
            allow subnets communicate with each other and go out to internet
        route tables
            used by implied router to route packets
            evaluated from top to bottom
        internet gateway (IGW)
            allow vpc communicate with internet
            ** host all the Elastic Network IP(ENI)
            ** NAT the ENI to a private IP associated with ec2 instance
        security groups
            function in the virtual nic level
            virtual firewall protecting EC2 instances
            *security groups are stateful
        network access control list (NACL)
            function in the subnet level
            first line of defense in vpc, protecting subnets
            *NACL are NOT stateful
        virtual private gateway (VGW)
            for communication between AWS and on premise datacenter

##
implied routers and route tables

    implied router
        central routing function within vpc
            connects different subnets
                communication within vpc
            connects vpc with IGW
                communication with internet
            connects vpc with VGW
                communication with on premise datacenter

    route tables
        define rules forwarding traffics within vpc
            **AWS create main route table by Default
                **for both default and custom vpc
            user create custom route tables
                up to 200 tables per vpc

        each subnet MUST be associated with only one route table
            route table has entries define forwarding rules
                up to 50 entries per route table

        subnet will associate with main route table if not specify
            can change subnet to associate with another route table

        main route table can be edited but NOT deleted
            can add or remove entries in main route table
            can set custom route table become main route table

        **every route table comes with default route
            **default route allows vpc subnets to communicate with each other
            **can NOT edit or delete this default route


##
ip addressing

    cannot change CIDR block range after vpc is created
        can expand existing vpc by adding secondary CIDR block
            new entry will add to each routable for this new CIDR block
            new CIDR block cannot overlap with existing CIDR block

    *different subnets within a vpc cannot overlap

    aws reserves 5 ip addresses in each subnet
        first 4 and last one are reserved
            fist ip is the base network
            second ip is the router
            third ip is DNS related
            forth ip is reserved for future
            last ip cannot be used

##
internet gateway(IGW)

    vpc communicate with internet through IGW
        supports both ip v4 and v6

    horizontally scale, redundant and highly available
        *IGW is completely provision aws services
            users do not need to manage it

    IGW performs NAT between your private and public ip v4 addresses
        EC2 instances public ips are configured in IGW and translated into private ips
            *public ips are not on EC2 instances

##
vpc types
    default vpc
        created in each region when an AWS account is created
        has default CIDR, security group, NACL, and route table
        has an IGW

    custom vpc
        created by AWS account owner
        user chooses CIDR block
        has its own security group, NACL, and route table
        does NOT have an IGW


 ##
 security groups
    virtual firewall functioning at the ENI of an EC2 instance
        up to 5 security group per instance

    ** has inbound direction and outbound direction
        inbound rules required resource
            ip range, security groups
        outbound rules required destination
            ip range, security groups

    ** can be shared within vpc but cannot share across vpc
    ** stateful
    ** can only have PERMIT rules, can NOT have deny rules
    ** every thing is DENY by default
    ** changes make to security group will be effect immediately

    **** default rules in default security group can be CHANGED
        ** default security group for both *default and *custom vpc
            ** inbound
                all allow source from same security group
            ** outbound
                all allow
        ** custom security group for default/custom vpc
            ** inbound
                all deny
            ** outbound
                all allow

    must specify security group while creating ec2 instance
        this is the default security group
            **CANNOT delete the default security group


## network access control list (NACLs)
    ** performed in the implied router
        implied router hosts NACL function

    ** function in the subnet level

    ** NACL is stateless

    ** rules must be explicit
        can have PERMIT and DENY rules in a NACL

    ** end with explicit deny any
        ** cannot delete this rule

    ** NACL is a set of rules
        ** each has a number
            check for a PERMIT from the lowest number
            until explicit/implicit deny is reach
        ** can INSERT between rules
            leave number range between two rules

    ** subnet must associate with NACL
        ** associate with default NACL if not specified

    ** default NACL for default/custom vpc ALLOWS ALL traffics by default
        inbound: allow
        outbound: allow
    ** custom NACL for default/custom DENY ALL traffic by default
        inbound: deny
        outbound: deny


##
create custom vpc
    custom vpc NOT include
        IGW
            no public ip address for ec2 instance
        subnet
            custom subnets do NOT auto assign public IP

    custom vpc include
        NACL
        security group
        route table
            **any route table, default or custom, has default route for traffic within vpc
                **this default route can NOT be removed
                **ec2 instances within vpc should *always be able to communicate with each other

            new subnets associate with this route table by default
                subnets can change route table association


##
security group format
    inbound:    type, protocol, port_range, source
    outbound:   type, protocol, port_range, destination

NACL
    inbound:    rule#, type, protocol, port_range, source,      allow/deny
    outbound:   rule#, type, protocol, port_range, destination, allow/deny


##
NAT
    NAT instance
        ec2 instance running special AMI
        ** hosted in public subnet
            ** need to assign security group
        ** configured private subnet route table
            add rule routing all outbound traffic to NAT instance

    private subnet ec2 instance need to be able to update software
        Access websites in the internet (http or https)

    NAT instance security group must allow
        traffic inbound from private subnet on port 80(http) or 443(https)
        traffic outbound to internet on port 80(http) or 443(https)
        traffic inbound from customer's own network on port 22(ssh)

    ** NAT instance must disable source destination check
        ec2 instance enable source destination check by Default
            meaning ec2 instance only allow traffic coming from and to itself
