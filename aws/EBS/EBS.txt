each EBS volume is replicated within its AZ

EBS volume must be in the same AZ as EC2 instance

by default, root EBS volume will be deleted when EC2 instance is terminated

by default, additional EBS volume will NOT be deleted when EC2 instance is terminated

volume size can be modified (increase/decrease) on the fly while the EC2 instance is running

volume type can be changed (upgrade/downgrade) on the fly while the EC2 instance is running
	even for the root volume
	
moving root volume to another AZ
	1. create a snapshot of the volume
	2. create an image out of the snapshot, use HVM which has more instance types supported
	3. launch the new instance in a new AZ using the new image
	4. can also copy the AMI into another region and launch new instance in that new region
		need to copy AMI to another region, AMI is regional
	
snapshots exist on S3, snapshots are incremental
	can take snapshot while the instance is running
	best practice to stop the instance before taking the snapshot

select AMI based on: 
	region, operating system, architecture, launch permission, root device volume
	
all AMIs are categorized as either 
	backed by Amazon EBS 
	backed by instance store
