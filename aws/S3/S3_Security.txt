*all S3 resources are private by default
	only resource owner can access the resource
	owner grant access to others by writing policy

resource policy
	applied directly to resource

user policy
	applied directly to IAM users

S3 has two types of resource policy
	ACL
		**grant basic read/write permissions on objects and buckets to aws accounts and predefined groups
		
	bucket policy
		**grant find-grained permissions on objects and buckets to aws accounts ad IAM users
			can grant to anyone (including anonymous users)
		
grant access to S3 through user policy
	applied directly to users, groups or roles using aws IAM 
		*grant user policy through IAM, NOT S3
		*cannot be used to grant anonymous access since they applied directly to users
		*cannot be applied to root user since this account is not an IAM user
	
cross account access
	One aws account grants permissions to its resources to another aws account
		**account A grant permissions to account B *via bucket policy
			need to user bucket policy because user policy cannot applied to root user
		**account B delegates permissions to an user via a user policy
	
	good for organizations with more than one accounts
		grant permissions to view other accounts billing and logs
		
evaluating policies
	bucket operation
		same account access
			*ALL policies are evaluated at the same time
			*if there is a deny policy, then deny
		
		cross account access
			*user account must first grant user permissions to the bucket via user policy
			*bucket owner must grant user account access via bucket policy
	
	object operation
		same account access
			*ALL policies are evaluated at the same time
			*if there is a deny policy, then deny
		
		cross account access
			*user account must first grant user permissions to the bucket via user policy
			*bucket owner must not explicitly deny access, *authorized by default
			**object owner must grant user access(an additional step to evaluate the object policy)
			
which policy should I use?
	prefer user policy or bucket policy
		these two can grant much finer permissions than ACL
	
	*some companies prefer only user policy
		**because they can keep all user policy in IAM
			
	**cases for using ACL
		to manage access to objects *NOT owned by the bucket owner
			**cannot use bucket policy on an object not owned by bucket owner
			
		to manage *INDIVIDUAL objects when permissions must vary between objects
			easier to user ACI than bucket policy
		
		to grant permissions to the "S3 Log Delivery Group" on a bucket
			one of the predefined groups
